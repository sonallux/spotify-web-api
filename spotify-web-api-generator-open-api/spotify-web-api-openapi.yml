The `albums` object contains an array of simplified [album objects](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-simplifiedalbumobject) (wrapped in a [paging object](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-pagingobject)) in JSON format. On error, the header status code is an [error code](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#response-status-codes) and the response body contains an [error object](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#response-schema).

            Once you have retrieved the list, you can use [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-an-albums-tracks) to drill down further.

            The results are returned in an order reflected within the Spotify clients, and therefore may not be ordered by date.

        To reorder items, include `range_start`, `insert_before`, `range_length` and `snapshot_id` in the request's body.
        To replace items, include `uris` as either a query parameter or in the request's body.
        Replacing items in a playlist will overwrite its existing items. This operation can be used for replacing or clearing items in a playlist.

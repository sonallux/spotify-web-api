          \ code `%20` or `+`.\n\n**Keyword matching** : Matching of search keywords\
          \ is *not* case-sensitive. Operators, however, should be specified in uppercase.\n\
          Unless surrounded by double quotation marks, keywords are matched in any\
          \ order. For example:\n`q=roadhouse&20blues` matches both \"Blues Roadhouse\"\
          \ and \"Roadhouse of the Blues\".\n`q=\"roadhouse&20blues\"` matches \"\
          My Roadhouse Blues\" but not \"Roadhouse of the Blues\".\n\nSearching for\
          \ **playlists** returns results where the query keyword(s) match any part\
          \ of the playlist's name or description. Only popular public playlists are\
          \ returned.\n\n**Operator**: The operator NOT can be used to exclude results.\n\
          \nFor example: `q=roadhouse%20NOT%20blues` returns items that match \"roadhouse\"\
          \ but excludes those that also contain the keyword \"blues\".\n\nSimilarly,\
          \ the OR operator can be used to broaden the search: `q=roadhouse%20OR%20blues`\
          \ returns all the results that include either of the terms. Only one OR\
          \ operator can be used in a query.\n\n*Note*: Operators must be specified\
          \ in uppercase. Otherwise, they are handled as normal keywords to be matched.\n\
          \n**Field filters** : By default, results are returned when a match is found\
          \ in *any* field of the target object type. Searches can be made more specific\
          \ by specifying an `album`, `artist` or `track` field filter.\n\nFor example:\
          \ The query `q=album:gold%20artist:abba&type=album` returns only albums\
          \ with the text \"gold\" in the album name and the text \"abba\" in the\
          \ artist name.\n\nTo limit the results to a particular `year`, use the field\
          \ filter year with album, artist, and track searches.\n\nFor example: `q=bob%20year:2014`\n\
          \nOr with a date range. For example: `q=bob%20year:1980-2020`\n\nTo retrieve\
          \ only albums released in the last two weeks, use the field filter tag:new\
          \ in album searches.\n\nTo retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity,\
          \ use the field filter tag:hipster in album searches.\n*Note*: This field\
          \ filter only works with album searches.\n\nDepending on object types being\
          \ searched for, other field filters, include genre (applicable to tracks\
          \ and artists), `upc`, and `isrc`.\nFor example: `q=lil%20genre:%22southern%20hip%20hop%22&type=artist`.\n\
          Use double quotation marks around the genre keyword string if it contains\
          \ spaces.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- Currently, you cannot fetch sorted results.\n\
          - You cannot search for playlists that contain a certain track.\n- You can\
          \ search only one genre at a time.\n- You cannot search for playlists within\
          \ a user's library.\n- In an effort to keep the response small, but include\
          \ as much information as possible, Spotify has expanded the response and\
          \ intends to continue and improve the Search endpoint.\n- To query based\
          \ on a release date query at a year level using the year scope. For example:\n\
          \n  The query\n\n  `https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=bob%20year:2014&type=album`\n\
          \n  Returns albums released in 2014 with their names or artist names containing\
          \ \"bob\". You can also use the tag:new field filter to get just these albums,\
          \ as well as compilations and singles, released in the last 2 weeks."
